# CSharpPractice(Assignment2)
 
I Covered Below Mentioned Topics in this Assignment

1) Factory Design Pattern
2) Dependency Injection
3) Delegated And Events

I made a Parser Interface, XMLInterface is implementing it.
In future more parser types can be added as per requirment, all parser types will implement Parser Interface.

On the base of Parser Type, Factory class will return respective Parser.

Once Parsing is done for any paragraph, an event will generate that will write data to file.
